        <h4>Job experience</h4>
        <p>I have worked in a farm of caged layer birds, where we keep birds for their eggs. 
        <br> I was mainly in charge of managing the sales of the eggs. 
        <br> We currently have <strong>1700 birds</strong>  in total, and out of those, <strong>700</strong> of them are for sale
